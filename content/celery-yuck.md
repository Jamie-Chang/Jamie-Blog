> I just don't like the taste!

When it comes to task processing in Python, [celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/v5.5.3/getting-started/introduction.html) is the most well known. And there is a ton of things to love about it! Just a quick scan of its home page reveals a few big features:

- Support for all sorts of concurrency models: pre-fork, gevent, threads ... 
- All the different broker types you can think of: AMQP, Redis, SQS ...
- Other features such as result storing and message routing
