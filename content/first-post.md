My name is Jamie Chang, I'm a software engineer in London. I like all things Python, but I'll try to mix it up sometimes. I decided to start this blog to get some of the ideas out from my head and to practice communicating technical topics.


For this site, I'm starting off with a Python static site generator called [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/) and Github pages to host the site.
